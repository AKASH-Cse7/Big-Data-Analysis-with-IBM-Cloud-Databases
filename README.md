# Big Data Analysis with IBM Cloud Databases

## Overview

Welcome to the Big Data Analysis project with IBM Cloud Databases! This README serves as a guide to understand the project's objectives, workflow, and key components. Please follow the instructions below to navigate through the project effectively.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to perform comprehensive big data analysis using IBM Cloud Databases. We aim to extract valuable insights from diverse datasets, including but not limited to climate data and social media trends. The project involves several phases, including data selection, database setup, data exploration, analysis techniques application, data visualization, and deriving business insights.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several phases, each with specific tasks and objectives:

1. **Data Selection**: Identify and select relevant datasets for analysis, including climate data or social media trends.

2. **Database Setup**: Configure IBM Cloud Databases to store and manage large datasets efficiently.

3. **Data Exploration**: Develop queries and scripts to explore and understand the selected datasets.

4. **Analysis Techniques**: Apply appropriate analysis techniques, such as statistical analysis or machine learning, to uncover insights.

5. **Visualization**: Design visualizations to present analysis results in an understandable and impactful manner.

6. **Business Insights**: Interpret analysis findings and derive valuable business intelligence and actionable recommendations.
